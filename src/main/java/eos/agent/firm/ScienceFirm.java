/**
 * The settlement's <b>science firm</b>: a labor-only firm that produces the colony's
 * research. It mirrors {@link BuilderFirm} and {@link StrategicFirm} — it hires on a
 * dedicated {@value #LABOR_MARKET} market (whose workers are the colony's
 * <b>scholars</b>: the nobles, and the ruler during the early ennoblement ramp,
 * supplying their {@link Skill#INTELLECTUAL} labor) and converts that labor into
 * <i>research points</i> by {@code A · L^beta} — but instead of building rings or
 * exporting a good, it delivers those points to the colony's {@link ResearchState}
 * (which advances the current research focus; see {@code docs/tech-tree.md}).
 * <p>
 * Research is a <b>crown-funded public good</b>: the firm sells nothing, so its wage
 * budget is funded each step out of the {@link Ruler ruler}'s treasury — the ruler
 * both directs research (it picks the monthly focus) and pays for it. The wages then
 * flow to the scholars when the market clears, so the firm is a near zero-profit
 * conduit (ruler → firm → scholars), exactly as the builder is for its peasants. A
 * colony with no ruler funds no scholars, so research simply does not advance.
