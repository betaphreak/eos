/**
 * One authoritative, hosted run of a {@link GameSession} — the server-side unit a browser
 * spectator subscribes to (see {@code docs/client-server.md}, Phase A). The host owns the
 * <b>tick authority</b>: a single loop, on its own (virtual) thread, that advances the
 * session one in-game day per tick, applies any due {@linkplain CommandLog commands} at the
 * deterministic <em>top of the tick</em>, and emits a render {@link SessionSnapshot} to its
 * subscribers.
 * <p>
 * <b>Determinism.</b> The colonies are advanced <em>sequentially</em> in lockstep (each
 * colony's whole day, in turn). Colonies never read one another mid-day (they draw from
 * disjoint RNG/name/mortality partitions — see {@code GameSession}), so this is
 * bit-identical to the concurrent lockstep of {@link
 * com.civstudio.simulation.SessionRunner}, while giving the host trivial, race-free control
 * over pacing. Pause/resume/step/rate affect only <em>wall-clock timing</em>, never sim
 * results; only commands change state, and they are tick-stamped, so any two replays of the
 * same spec + command log produce identical state.
 * <p>
 * <b>Snapshots are assembled on this thread</b> (in {@link #emit()}, between ticks) and
 * cached; a subscriber — including a late joiner — receives the cached last snapshot, so
 * the projection never races {@code newDay}, and a slow subscriber never stalls the sim
 * (the transport is expected to hand off to its own buffer).
