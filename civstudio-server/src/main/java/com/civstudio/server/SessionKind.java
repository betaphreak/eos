 * null, scenario)}, which was a load-bearing coincidence: "demo = unowned" broke the moment a public
 * sandbox or a tutorial existed. See {@code docs/session-management.md}.
 *
 * <p>Kind is the <em>category</em>; the specific variant within it is the open-set {@code mode} string
 * (e.g. {@code "sandbox"}, {@code "royale"}), and the challenge is {@code difficulty} (a Civ4 handicap
 * key). Those are additive — new modes / difficulties need no new enum value here.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #DEMO} — the unowned shop-window run anyone may watch (the server-seeded caravan demo).</li>
 * <li>{@link #SINGLE_PLAYER} — an owned save slot; private to its owner.</li>
 * <li>{@link #MULTIPLAYER} — a shared, non-ranked run (co-op / free-play modes to come). Reserved; no
 *     founding path creates one yet.</li>
 * <li>{@link #TIMELINE} — the shared ranked Timeline (a last-colony-standing royale). Public to watch;
 *     its clock is admins-only, and its seats are owned per colony.</li>
