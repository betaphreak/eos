/**
 * A read-only projection of one {@link com.civstudio.settlement.Settlement colony} for the
 * live feed — the same aggregates the annual digest and the CSV printers report, gathered
 * into an immutable, JSON-serializable record. Assembled on the session thread by {@link
 * Snapshots} between ticks (never during {@code newDay}), so its reads see a settled
 * population.
 *
 * @param name           the colony's name
 * @param alive          whether the colony is still running
 * @param date           the colony's current in-game date (ISO-8601)
 * @param population     the workforce (laborer households)
 * @param children       under-age members (household-born + pool wards)
 * @param nobles         noble households
 * @param firms          living firms
 * @param poolSize       peasant-pool reserve size
 * @param cpi            the consumer price index (inflation)
 * @param necessityPrice last clearing price of the necessity (food) market
 * @param enjoymentPrice last clearing price of the enjoyment market
 * @param plotCount      claimed build plots
 * @param maxPlots       the colony's plot ceiling (its province cap)
 * @param latitude       the colony's latitude (decimal degrees) — the map anchor
 * @param longitude      the colony's longitude (decimal degrees)
 * @param bankProfitTax  the ruler's bank-profit tax rate (the player-set lever), 0 if none
 * @param nobleIncomeTax the ruler's noble-income tax rate (the player-set lever), 0 if none
 * @param advisors       the colony's privy council — the court noble seated in each
 *                       filled advisor role (unfilled roles are absent)
 * @param knownTechs     the tech ids this colony knows (its pre-known baseline plus what it has
 *                       researched) — drives the web tech tree's researched (unlocked) styling;
 *                       empty when the colony has no research state
 * @param startingDistricts the number of districts the city begins with — its founding province's
 *                       EU4 1444 development (ADM+DIP+MIL), capped at the province plots; 0 for a
 *                       province-less colony (see {@code docs/district-buildout.md} Phase D1)
 * @param culture        the colony's Anbennar culture (from its founding province) — the web folds
 *                       it to a district art-style set (D5); {@code null} for a province-less colony
 * @param districts      the district plots carrying buildings (the placed-building state the district
 *                       view stamps); empty until auto-build places anything. See {@link DistrictView}
 * @param researchingTech the tech id the colony is currently researching (its research focus), or
 *                       {@code null} when nothing is being researched — drives the Technology segment
 * @param researchProgress fraction (0..1) of the current focus's cost accumulated so far; 0 when
 *                       there is no focus
 * @param tier           the rung the colony sits on the {@link com.civstudio.settlement.SettlementTier}
 *                       ladder ({@code CAMP < COTTAGE < HAMLET < SMALLHOLDING < TOWN < METROPOLIS}),
 *                       as the raw enum name — the web Title Cases it for the Settlement-band caption
 *                       (see {@code docs/zoom-bands.md} §Band caption). {@code null} for a colony with
 *                       no tier set
 * @param provinceId     the province the colony sits in, or 0 when it has none. The view already
 *                       ships {@code latitude}/{@code longitude}, but a client cannot turn those back
 *                       into a province without inverting the map projection — so the web rail reads
 *                       this to show a selected province's live colony inline
 * @param centerX        the raster x of the colony's {@linkplain com.civstudio.settlement.Settlement#getCityCenter()
 *                       city-center plot} — the water-first plot the colony actually founded on, in the
 *                       same source-pixel space as the web's plot coordinates. {@code null} when no plot
 *                       is laid yet. The colony's {@code latitude}/{@code longitude} are its
 *                       <b>province's</b> anchor, not its centre (see {@code docs/urban-plots.md}), so a
 *                       client with only those rings the wrong plot — this says the centre outright
 * @param centerY        the raster y of the city-center plot, or {@code null} when no plot is laid
 * @param queue          the crown's build queue — what it is building, how far along, and what is
 *                       ordered behind it (see {@link BuildQueueView}); {@link BuildQueueView#NONE}
 *                       for a colony with no build economy
