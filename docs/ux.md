# Web UX — navigation, camera framing & chrome

How the WorldMap page (`web/`) behaves as an interface: URL deep links, how focusing a province
frames it, pan/zoom clamping, and the on-screen chrome (zoom readout, collapsible sidebar, floating
search, status line, theme). Pure client-side + static hosting — no server compute. The map
*rendering* pipeline (terrain, shore, sea, resource icons) lives in [`coastlines.md`](coastlines.md)
and the per-plot docs; this file is the interaction layer over it.

The relevant modules: `core.mjs` (camera/projection, `cam`, `VIEW`, `clampPan`), `main.mjs` (`draw`,
`focusProvince`/`focusProvinceFit`, deep link), `panel.mjs` (all DOM: selection, sidebar, search,
mode toggle, keyboard), `index.html` + `styles.css` (chrome markup + layout).

## Deep links — `?p=<id>&z=<zoom>` (2026-07)

Focusing a province from the URL accepts a **query string** (`?p=<id>&z=<zoom>` — the
shareable/production form) as well as the legacy `#p=…&z=…` hash; the query wins when both are
present (`readDeepLink`/`applyHash` in `main.mjs`, also re-applied on `popstate`). `z` is optional.

- **Production path.** On Azure Static Web Apps the existing `navigationFallback` (see
  `web/staticwebapp.config.json`) rewrites an unknown route to `index.html`, so a pretty
  `/worldmap?p=…&z=…` path serves the app and the query rides through untouched — **no server change,
  no Azure Function**. Use `/worldmap` with **no trailing slash** so the relative `data.js`/`js/*`
  script paths still resolve to root. A plain local `http.server` 404s on `/worldmap`, so for local
  debugging use the root form `/?p=…&z=…`.
- **Timing.** Applied after first layout (`requestAnimationFrame` in `boot`) so the camera math sees a
  sized `VIEW` — the old inline-at-boot call silently no-opped.
- **Debugging.** `tools/webverify/shot.mjs` drives it for headless province screenshots:
  `node shot.mjs <baseUrl> <p> <z> <out.png>`.

## Focus framing & pan clamp (2026-07)

- **Fit-to-frame focus.** Focusing a province (deep link with no `?z=`, or search-select) uses
  `focusProvinceFit` — the province bbox fits **0.9 of the canvas**, centred — instead of a fixed
  far-out zoom, so it fills most of the canvas. An explicit `?z=` still sets that exact zoom via
  `focusProvince`. Ring-less provinces (no bbox) fall back to a deep fixed zoom.
- **`clampPan` centring margin.** The vertical pan clamp (`clampAxis`, `core.mjs`) allows the map's
  top/bottom edge to reach the viewport **centre** (margin = `viewDim/2`), so a province at the very
  edge of the mapped latitudes can actually be centred; the polar sea gradient fills the gap beyond
  the edge. Trade-off: manual panning can now push the map half-off-screen vertically — acceptable for
  centring edge features, tighten the margin if bounded panning is wanted back.
- **Reset.** `resetView` (`panel.mjs`) returns to the world view (`cam.k=1`, centred); bound to the
  `0`/`Home` keys and the zoom-readout button.

## Chrome

**Dedicated top & bottom bars.** `.app` stacks a fixed-height header (`.topbar`, `--bar-h: 54px`) above the
map and a footer (`.footbar`, `--foot-h: 58px`) below it; the map (`.stage`) and the sidebar (`.railwrap`)
sit between them (`top: var(--bar-h); bottom: var(--foot-h)`), so **nothing overlays the map** — the
title/buttons/search live in the top bar and the **timeline/playback lives in the bottom bar (all modes,
not just caravan)**. Both bars are pinned to the dark palette regardless of UI theme (like the map hero).
The small `.zoomctl` (+/−/fullscreen) and the caravan `.legend` still float in the map's bottom corners.

> **Planned change (not yet built):** the top bar's ad-hoc toggle groups (POV / plane / overlay)
> become a single **advisor-mode selector** (race-portrait buttons) with a **second sub-control row**
> below it; the tech modal becomes the **Technology Advisor** map-mode, and the `#clock` transport +
> sign-in move into the **Zeitgeist** advisor. Design: [`privy-council.md`](privy-council.md).
Tooltips are automatic for any `[data-tip]` element (`showBtnTip`, `panel.mjs`).

Bar layout (left → right): **brand wordmark**, **zoom readout**, centered **mode toggle**, then a right
group (`.topright`) of **cost / heat / theme** buttons and the **search** pill.

- **Brand wordmark** (leftmost). `CivStudio: Anbennar` in the project serif stack (Constantia / Cambria /
  Georgia — system fonts, CSP-safe), gold + light two-tone. Replaced the old two-line title block over the
  canvas (`setMode` no longer swaps a title).
- **Zoom readout button** (beside the wordmark). `#zoomLevel` shows the live magnification (`1×`…`256×`,
  updated each `draw`) and, when clicked, runs `resetView`.
- **Collapsible sidebar.** `.railwrap` is a right overlay (below the bar) that slides in via `.open`
  (`showRail`). It opens on province / journey selection and on caravan mode; collapses on **Esc**, the
  **×** close button, or re-clicking the selected province (`closePanel` also restores a focused camera).
  Since the bar spans full width above it, the top controls no longer need to shift to clear it. **Note:**
  the old sidebar intro/overview shows only when the panel is open — the default view is map-first.
- **Search.** A pill in the bar's right group (`.searchbar`), always present. Type a name or id → pick →
  `goToProvince` fits + selects it.
- **Bottom status line.** `#statusline` (fixed, slides up, colour-keyed by kind, click to dismiss,
  auto-hides) surfaces errors/warnings: `window.onerror` + `unhandledrejection` + wrapped
  `console.error`/`warn`, wired in an **early inline script** in `index.html` so it catches even
  module-load failures. `window.__status(msg, kind)` posts arbitrary app messages (`kind`:
  `info`/`warn`/`error`).
- **Dark by default.** `index.html` ships `data-theme="dark"`; the theme toggle (`themeBtn`) still
  flips light/dark.

## Redraw / compute

- **rAF-coalesced redraw** (`main.mjs`). The public `draw()` only *requests* a paint — it sets a flag and
  schedules one `requestAnimationFrame` that runs the real `paint()`. A burst of pan/zoom/pinch events
  (mobile fires many `touchmove`s per frame) collapses into a single scene render per frame. All existing
  `draw()` callers get this for free.
- **Bonus overlay reuses the plot cull.** `drawPlots` collects the in-view provinces it already culled into a
  `vis` list and hands it to `drawBonusOverlay`, so the icon pass doesn't re-scan all ~5088 provinces.
- Engine (Java sim) compute is intentionally **not** optimized yet — ruler runs collapse in ~6–10 in-game
  years (short) and the design is in flux; profile `market.clear()` / `agent.act()` under a *long* run once
  survival calibration lands, before optimizing.
