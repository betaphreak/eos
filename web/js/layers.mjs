// The LAYER REGISTRY — the single source of truth for the scene's draw ORDER (array order =
// back-to-front paint order), per-layer GATING, and a band annotation. main.renderScene() runs
// renderLayers() once per on-screen world copy. To reorder a layer, move its line; to change when
// it appears, edit its `gate`; the actual band fade is single-sourced inside each draw fn (Phase 2)
// and summarised here in `band`. This is the "draw order + band mapping in one place" seam —
// see docs/zoom-bands.md §Layer registry.
//
// The draw fns live in the modules that own their state (main.mjs closes over the raster/camera and
// the province-polygon helpers; the overlays own their own); this module only orders and gates them.
