// FPS here is NOT a free-running rAF counter, and it is NOT paints-per-second either. This app paints
// ON DEMAND — main.draw() coalesces to at most one paint per animation frame and paints nothing at all
// when the camera is still. So a rAF loop would report the display's refresh rate (a constant 60) no
// matter how slow a frame really was, and counting paints per second would report the map's DEMAND
// rate: an idle map that renders 7 cheap frames in a second would read "7fps", which looks like a
// catastrophe and is actually nothing at all.
//
// What the number means here is render CAPABILITY: 1000 / the average cost of the frames we did draw.
// A 7ms frame reads ~140fps whether we drew one of them or sixty, and a heavy world-zoom frame at 63ms
// reads ~16fps — which is the thing worth knowing, and the thing that moves when the renderer
// regresses. main.paint() feeds noteFrame() its own measured duration; when nothing has been drawn
// recently there is no fresh cost to report, so the last reading is held and dimmed.
