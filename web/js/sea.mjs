// The OCEAN — the screen-space base the whole scene floats on.
//
// Why this is its own module and its own registry (SCREEN_LAYERS in layers.mjs) rather than a normal
// LAYERS entry: everything in LAYERS is drawn once per on-screen WORLD COPY, because the cylindrical
// wrap re-renders the scene per copy with a shifted camera. This is SCREEN-SPACE — it fills the
// viewport once, from the latitude at each screen row, and knows nothing about world copies. Running
// it per copy would re-fill the same pixels N times and, worse, composite the soft-light ripple N
// times over itself (each pass darkening the last). So it is drawn once per frame, ahead of the wrap
// loop, and the registry models that as a separate ordered stack instead of pretending it is a
// per-copy layer.
//
// Extracted from main.mjs, which had accumulated it as hardcoded calls inside paint() — the last
// draws in the scene that weren't in a registry. See docs/zoom-bands.md §Layer registry.

// REMOVED (2026-07-16): the screen-space polar ICE CAP that used to sit over this — a latitude-ramped
// Civ4 pack-ice tile across the open ocean. It was the single most expensive draw in the scene
// (~18.8 ms/frame at Atlas zoom, more than every other layer combined, and the reason world zoom ran
// ~12 fps) and it did not earn that: it read as a grey tiling expanse over the empty polar seas.
// Deleted rather than optimised. The per-plot coastal shelf floes (plots.drawSeaIce) are unaffected —
// those are driven by real FEATURE_ICE terrain data at deep zoom and are baked into the plot canvas.
