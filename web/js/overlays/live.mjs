// This replaces the old #liveHud rail panel. That panel made Live mode the one mode with its own
// bespoke rail, and filled it with three different kinds of thing: session debug (tick, session id),
// colony vitals, and tax WRITE controls. They have gone three ways:
//   - tick / session id: dropped. The date is already in the Zeitgeist clock, and the rest was
//     debug-grade readout that no spectator was reading.
//   - colony vitals: here, in the top bar — they describe the SESSION, so they should not depend on
//     where the camera is (the same reasoning as the Zeitgeist segment's colony label). The
//     per-province detail lives inline in the province rail instead (panel.provinceRail).
//   - tax levers: moved to the admin console (web/admin.html), where the other write controls
//     already are and where the ROLE_ADMIN gate already applies.
// Live mode now uses the same rail as every other mode.
