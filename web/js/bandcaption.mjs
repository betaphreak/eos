// The BAND CAPTION — the top bar's contextual readout. Where the Main Map sub-strip used to carry
// one frozen string ("Physical world · terrain & plots"), it now answers "what am I looking at?"
// for the band you're actually in: a continent at WORLD, a region at REGION, the majority terrain
// at TERRAIN, an address at PLOT. It is the prose counterpart to the band-name chip beside it —
// the chip names the RUNG, this names the THING.
//
// Two rules keep it honest:
//   1. One table, one row per band (mirroring the ADVISORS table in advisors.mjs) — adding a band
//      or retuning its text is a one-line edit, never a new branch in a switch.
//   2. Every row degrades to a truthful fallback. The data a caption wants is band-dependent and
//      streams in asynchronously (plots only exist once drawPlots has fetched them; owner/religion
//      only after ensurePolitical), so a row that can't answer says so rather than showing a stale
//      or invented value.
//
// See docs/zoom-bands.md §Band caption.

// which is what a reader would call "where I am" when the centre is empty sea.
