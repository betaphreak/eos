/**
 * The <b>ruler</b> of the settlement: the owner of its gold bank. Unlike a
 * {@link Noble} the ruler is not a rentier who draws dividends —
 * it is a <b>treasury that indulges</b>. It holds its fortune (gold) at the gold
 * bank, of which it is the sole account holder (the bank has no other clients),
 * and earns nothing, but each step it spends a small fraction of the treasury on
 * <b>enjoyment</b> — a sovereign luxury habit that slowly draws the reserves down.
 * Because enjoyment is priced in copper, that spending converts gold to copper, so
 * the gold bank skims its currency-exchange fee. It also keeps a lavish table —
 * eating the {@link RationSize#GOURMET} ration each step and restocking
 * necessity toward a reserve (also copper-quoted, so it likewise fires the FX fee).
 * There is one ruler per settlement; it never starves.
 * <p>
 * Like the other households the ruler is a named {@link AbstractHousehold} that
 * ages on the mortality schedule and, when its head dies of old age, is
 * succeeded by a heir of the same dynasty who inherits the treasury (so the line
 * endures). It is skilled and tracked as a person of interest, but sells no
 * labor and owns no firms.
