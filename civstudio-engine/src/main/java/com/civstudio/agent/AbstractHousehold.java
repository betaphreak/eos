 * consolidates the machinery that {@link Laborer},
 * {@link Noble} and {@link Ruler} previously
 * each carried verbatim:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the household <b>identity</b> — its {@link #getMembers() members} (for now
 * a single {@link Person}, the {@code head}, drawn with a given-name rarity
 * tracking skill), the head's {@code birthDate}, the household's
 * {@code foundingDate}, and its {@code skill} — all sampled at construction on
 * the demographic / naming RNGs (never the economic stream);</li>
 * <li><b>account opening</b>, either as a fresh endowment or funded out of the
 * bank's equity (a successor's inheritance or an open-colony immigrant);</li>
 * <li><b>age</b> ({@link #getAgeYears()}) and liquid
 * {@link #getWealth() wealth};</li>
 * <li><b>death settlement</b> — snapshotting the estate so a successor of the
 * same dynasty can inherit it, then closing the account
 * ({@link #dieAndSettleEstate()}), with the per-member old-age check
 * ({@link #checkOldAgeDeath()}) on top.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Subclasses supply only what differs: how the household earns and spends in
 * {@link #act()}, which goods it holds in {@link #getGood(String)}, and any
 * person-of-interest registration or founding log they wish to emit. The
 * constructor draws skill before the head, exactly as the original classes did,
 * so identity values stay byte-identical for a given seed.
