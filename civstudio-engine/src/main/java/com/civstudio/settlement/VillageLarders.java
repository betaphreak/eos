/**
 * The <b>village-larder subsystem</b> (city-of-hamlets V2, {@code docs/city-of-hamlets-plan.md}): the
 * per-hamlet {@link Larder} food pools that organize a city's food per <b>village</b> rather than per
 * household, and the daily <b>provisioning</b> that keeps them stocked. Present only when {@code
 * SimulationConfig.villageLarder} is on ({@link Settlement#enableVillageLarders()}); a flag-off colony
 * never builds one and stays byte-identical (its {@link Settlement#getVillageLarders()} is {@code
 * null}, and food keeps running through the per-household necessity stock).
 * <p>
 * <b>The provisioned floor.</b> A village's peasant households eat from its larder for free (the lord
 * feeds his vassals); the larder is filled by their home-plot subsistence and topped up by the
 * village's <b>leader</b> (its fief-holder {@link com.civstudio.agent.noble.Noble}, or the {@link
 * com.civstudio.agent.ruler.Ruler} for Crown demesne) buying the deficit on the shared Necessity
 * market. The leader <em>pays</em> — so the village is the market's food participant and its demand
 * drives price discovery — but the food is delivered into the larder, via the market's
 * delivery-target seam ({@link ConsumerGoodMarket#addBuyOffer(Agent, com.civstudio.good.Good,
 * Demand)}). A leader buys only what its purse affords, so a poor lord under-provisions (its village
 * goes hungry — the failure the survival tests gate) rather than borrowing without bound.
