 * Ownership is <b>hybrid</b>: a plot is free (province-owned, {@link Plot#owner()}

 * settlement; {@link #release(Plot) releasing} returns it to the free pool. A
 * settlement claims via {@link #claimFoundingCenter} (its first plot, spaced from
 * any other settlement already in the province) then {@link #claimNearest} (each
 * subsequent plot, nearest its center). Because several settlements in one province
 * claim from the same pool — concurrently, under the lockstep
 * {@link com.civstudio.simulation.SessionRunner} — every mutating operation is
 * {@code synchronized}; a claim that finds no free plot returns {@code null} (the
