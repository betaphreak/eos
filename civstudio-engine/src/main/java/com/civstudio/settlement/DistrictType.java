 * <b>minimal starter set</b> (the {@link #CITY_CENTER} plus one district per
 * {@link Advisor} branch); it grows as placement matures.
 * <p>
 * A district's type is <b>derived from the buildings standing on the plot</b> — the
 * {@code category} of {@link Plot#buildings()} (each building's {@code <Advisor>}
 * branch, the shared taxonomy from {@code buildings.json}), folded here by
 * {@link #fromCategory(Advisor)} — <i>not</i> from the plot's occupant firm. The
 * founding plot (plot 0, the village center) is seeded {@link #CITY_CENTER}. Because
 * the derivation is a pure function of the placed buildings, whichever layer holds the
 * building categories (the server render snapshot, joining {@code /api/buildings})
 * computes it; the engine owns the underlying state (the placed building ids and the
 * district count — {@link Settlement#getStartingDistrictCount()}).
