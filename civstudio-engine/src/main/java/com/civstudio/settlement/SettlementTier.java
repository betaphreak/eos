/**
 * The rung a settlement occupies on the unified settle&hairsp;&rlarr;&hairsp;unsettle growth
 * ladder — the single source of truth for how settled/developed a band is, from the transient
 * camp a caravan sleeps in up to a full metropolis. A settlement founds low and climbs; on
 * decline it descends and, at the foot, departs as a wandering caravan again. See {@code
 * docs/settlement-tier-ladder-plan.md} and {@code docs/settlement-tiers.md}.
 * <p>
 * The rungs are ordered {@code CAMP < COTTAGE < HAMLET < SMALLHOLDING < TOWN < METROPOLIS}, and
 * {@link #atLeast(SettlementTier)} compares that order. The names are deliberately distinct from
 * the household-command {@link com.civstudio.agent.Rank} rungs — the old <em>Village</em> and
 * <em>City</em> rungs were renamed to {@link #SMALLHOLDING} and {@link #METROPOLIS} — so the two
 * axes never collide: this tier is the <em>place's</em> development, while the head household's
 * {@code Rank} (Captain&rarr;Ruler&rarr;Mayor) is <em>derived from</em> it.
 * <p>
 * Capability thresholds read off the order: a settlement {@linkplain Settlement#hasDistricts()
 * has districts} and is {@linkplain Settlement#isPermanent() permanent} from {@link #TOWN} up.
 * <p>
 * <b>Growth is food-driven (Civ4-style).</b> A settlement banks its daily net food surplus in a
 * {@linkplain Settlement#getFoodBox() food box}; when the box clears the current rung's {@link
 * #foodToChange()} it grows one rung (a sustained deficit that drains the box below {@code
 * -foodToChange()} shrinks it one rung — starvation). Two extra gates guard growth: a rung of
 * {@linkplain #size() size} <var>N</var> needs at least {@link #minHouseholds() N&sup2; households},
 * and reaching {@link #METROPOLIS} additionally needs &ge;&thinsp;{@value #METROPOLIS_POP_GATE}
 * people. The costs are size-scaled and deliberately <b>uncalibrated</b> (a tuning lever).
 * <p>
 * <b>Deferred.</b> {@code SUBURBS} (a province-level merge of several towns into one metropolis)
 * is a separate future operation, not a linear rung, so it is intentionally absent here.
